# CodeIgniter 4 Application Starter

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](http://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds a composer-installable app starter.
It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [the announcement](http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-62615.html) on the forums.

The user guide corresponding to this version of the framework can be found
[here](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/).

## Installation & updates

`composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter` then `composer update` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.

When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply
to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from
`vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.

## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!

## Repository Management

We use Github issues, in our main repository, to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.
We use our [forum](http://forum.codeigniter.com) to provide SUPPORT and to discuss
FEATURE REQUESTS.

This repository is a "distribution" one, built by our release preparation script.
Problems with it can be raised on our forum, or as issues in the main repository.
